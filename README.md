# Ambulance Router Optimization

A web-based application that helps find the **shortest and fastest routes for ambulances** using **DSA algorithms** like Dijkstra. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the project leverages **local storage** for data persistence and allows exporting route information as **PDF** using **jsPDF** and **PDF.js**.

## Features
- Find the shortest route for ambulances using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.
- Store route and patient data locally in the browser.
- Export route information as **PDF**.
- Interactive and responsive user interface.
- Easy visualization of routes.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Algorithms: Dijkstra and other graph-based algorithms
- Libraries: jsPDF, PDF.js
- Storage: LocalStorage

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter the source and destination locations for the ambulance.
3. The app will calculate the **shortest route** using Dijkstra's algorithm.
4. Save or export route information as a **PDF** for records.

## Algorithms Used
- Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path calculation.
- Additional graph-based techniques for route optimization.

## Installation
No installation required. Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paras-00/ambulance-router-optimization.git
